# 🎶 Music Genre Clustering using Unsupervised Learning

This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to group music tracks based on audio features — without using labeled genre data. The goal is to discover natural groupings in music that may correspond to genres.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](Spotify-2000.csv)
- Contains audio tracks from various genres
- Used only the **features**, not the genre labels

---


---

## 📊 Algorithms Used

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**


Dimensionality Reduction:
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)


---

## 📈 Project Workflow
1. **Feature Extraction** from each audio file
2. **Scaling** and normalization
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA or t-SNE)
4. **Clustering** using K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.
5. **Evaluation** using:
   - Visualization of clusters
   - (Optionally) compare cluster labels with true genres to measure alignment
